### Initial Notes

Quite a difficult tutorial to follow, perhaps should of beeen introduced later in the series. 

seemed to be pair programming of files [JsonConsumer.java](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/06-streaming/java/kafka_examples/src/main/java/org/example/JsonConsumer.java) and [JsonProducer.java](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/blob/main/06-streaming/java/kafka_examples/src/main/java/org/example/JsonProducer.java).

Perhaps with other lesson in this series it will be easier to follow this one along.
