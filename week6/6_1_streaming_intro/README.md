### What is data exchange

* can think of it as a postal service that transfers data from 1 place to another

* most common form is via API

* can simplify the mechanisms of an application as follows

  - there is a notice board with various topics of information populated regularly by producers

  - consumers/audience are not interested in all topics, just keys targets

  - when a producer provides an update in the notice board for only 1 topic, then the consumers interested in that topic only will be notified

* In stream processing, data exchange occurs in more real time

* real time is defined by a few seconds of delay but much faster than batch processing
