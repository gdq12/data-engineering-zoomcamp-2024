### I. Orchestration Background

- dependecy management facilitated through automation

- impotant notes:

    * every workflow requires sequential steps 

    * bad orchestration can deteriorate data quality 

    * step = dags 

    * fundamentals of data engineering (good book to read) 

    * orchestration is "under current" --> occurs throughout whole lifecycle, key to data engineering pipelines

- good orchestration solution qualifications 

    * work flow management (scheduling, resources, manage tasks, dependencies)

    * automation 

    * error handle/recovery --> should have built in solutions for failed tasks 

    * recovery mechanism

    * monitor alerts for fails 

    * resource optimization --> find best route for execution 

    * observability: being visible or observe in all parts of pipeline

    * debugging should be easy to do 

    * compliance/auditing capabilities

- prioritize developer experience  

    * flow state: reduce switching btw tools

    * feedback loops: in real time for faster debugging 

    * cognitive load: easy to follow along
